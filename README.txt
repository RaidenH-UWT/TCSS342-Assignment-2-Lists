1) Biggest challenge you faced while rearranging the nodes in Singly Linked List?
the swap method.

2) Do you think a doubly linked list would have been a better option? Why?
much better, being able to traverse backwards in the swap would have made navigating much easier.

3) Report the difference between the execution time of running Shellsort on ArrayList
vs SLL. Report the time for all inputs in a tabular format.
SLL MUCH worse, measured in minutes at it's worst rather than fractions of seconds.
